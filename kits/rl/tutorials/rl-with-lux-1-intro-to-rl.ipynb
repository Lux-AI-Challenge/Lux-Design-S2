It's what enables an agent in an environment to repeatedly interact and improve itself.\n","\n","We discretize time in an environment into individual **time steps** labeled as `t` below. At each time step, the agent uses the current environment observation (also known as state) $S_t$ to produce an action $A_t$ and executes that action in the environment. The environment updates in response to the action and gives the agent a new observation $S_{t+1}$ as well as a reward signal $R_{t+1}$ telling the agent how well it is doing. Eventually the environment will tell the agent it is completed and this completes one full episode.\n","\n","![](https://github.com/Lux-AI-Challenge/Lux-Design-S2/blob/main/kits/rl/tutorials/assets/rl_loop.jpg?raw=1)\n","\n","These days, in deep RL the agent is typically a deep neural network that takes an observation as input and produces an action as output.\n","\n","While the agent is continously interacting, it will also periodically update its neural network via an optimization algorithm with a few objectives. Training in RL requires balancing exploration and exploitation. While the overall goal of the agent is to exploit and to **maximize return** (the sum of rewards in an episode), you can easily learn suboptimal behaviors if you don't explore sufficiently in an environment to find better strategies. This explore vs exploitation problem is a foundational problem in RL that is still researched to this day.\n","\n","For a deep dive into the math and algorithms the [Spinning Up project](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/) provides a great tutorial on some of the modern deep RL algorithms.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"fc70a510","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.007535,"end_time":"2023-02-02T01:15:32.663687","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-02-02T01:15:32.656152","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["### 1.1 Environment Loop Code\n","\n","Let's get programming!

When it's `True` it means the episode is completed and you must call `env.reset()` before stepping through it again. Episode completion can occur for a number of reasons depending on the chosen environment. For CartPole-v0, `done` is `True` whenever a time limit is reached or if the pole falls down too far.
